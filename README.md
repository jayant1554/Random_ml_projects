# Random ML Projects

Welcome to the **Random ML Projects** repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that explore a variety of concepts, algorithms, and real-world applications. These projects are aimed at learning, experimenting, and sharing knowledge in the field of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
(just want to play around with different type of datasets and algo )

## About

This repository serves as a portfolio of random ML projects that showcase various:

- **ML Algorithms**: Implementation of supervised and unsupervised techniques.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and insights from datasets.
- **NLP & Computer Vision**: Tackling projects involving text and images.
- **End-to-End Projects**: Data processing pipelines, model training, and deployment.

These projects are created to:
- Solve interesting problems.
- Experiment with new libraries and tools.
- Enhance understanding of ML concepts.
